# Components
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

## Functional Components
The Functional components are inside their own folder, usually split in two files, being one for its logic and props, and the other for its styling.

## Styled Components
The Styled Components are not in their own folder like the Functional Components.
